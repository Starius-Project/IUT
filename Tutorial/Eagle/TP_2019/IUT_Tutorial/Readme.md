### PROJECT

## Information

Create a shutter with a mini USB (MINI-USB-UX60-MB-5ST) and a CP2101 for USB to UART, an ATMEGA8-AU (microcontroller) with all required components (resistor, capacitor, quartz)
 and two optocouplers (REF:4N35SM) to control a DSLR (camera). You can add led for status.
 Use a jack connector for DSLR (PG203J).

Activate shutter with two buttons (two pins per button for connection on front panel) , Focus and take a picture.
